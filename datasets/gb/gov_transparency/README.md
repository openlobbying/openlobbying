# Government Transparency returns

Government departments in the UK publish regular transparency returns covering ministers, special advisers, and senior officials. `config.yml` includes a list of these publications identified so far.

These returns mainly cover meetings with external organisations, gifts, hospitality, and travel. Additionally, we have some returns on things like receptions, outside employment, etc.

To review and include:
- [ ] [DHSC registers of board members' interests - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dhsc-registers-of-board-members-interests) / [DWP register of board members’ interests - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dwp-register-of-board-members-interests) / [Cabinet Office register of board members’ interests - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/cabinet-office-register-of-board-members-interests)
- [ ] [DESNZ: Ministerial gifts, hospitality, travel and meetings with external organisations - data.gov.uk](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/2673218b-0888-4617-a94e-9df90f75117f/ministerial-gifts-hospitality-travel-and-meetings-with-external-organisations)
- [ ] [Special advisers: gifts and hospitality - gov.scot](https://www.gov.scot/collections/special-advisers-gifts-and-hospitality/)

## File formats

Across the current configured collection list:

- `8,810` attachments have a `.csv` filename
- `287` attachments have a `.xlsx` filename
- `225` attachments have a `.ods` filename
- `64` attachments have a `.xls` filename
- `27` attachments have a `.xlsm` filename
- `25` attachments are HTML publications containing tabular data

Important caveat:

- Some older files are served with Excel MIME types but are actually CSV files.
- File extension is more reliable than MIME type, but both can be wrong.

These files have a wide variety of internal structures, with many quirks and edge cases. Column names aren't consistent, date formats vary widely even within the same column.

Here are some examples of recurring structures:

- Single clean CSV table with a single header row
- CSVs with one file per activity type
- CSVs with one file per person and per activity type
- Old CSVs with month-level dates like `Oct-12`
- CSVs where rows are explicit `Nil Return`
- Workbooks with multiple sheets such as `Gifts`, `Hospitality`, `Meetings`, `Travel`
- Workbooks with a `Notes` sheet describing the meaning of the other sheets
- Workbooks where person names appear once and are blank on following rows
- Workbooks mixing exact dates, month names, and date ranges in one column
- Workbooks with unused helper sheets like `Sheet2`
- HTML publications with proper `<table>` markup
- HTML publications whose table represents a different transparency dataset type such as outside employment

## Types of data

This dataset covers several recurring transparency return types, including:

- meetings with external organisations, media, and stakeholders
- gifts given and received
- hospitality received
- overseas travel and domestic official visits
- official receptions and charity receptions
- guests at Chequers and other official hospitality guest lists
- outside employment and similar declaration-style tables in some HTML publications

These can appear as one-file-per-activity CSVs, mixed workbooks with multiple activity tabs, Prime Minister-specific layouts, special adviser returns, senior official returns, and older legacy templates with nil-only publications or explanatory note rows.

## Current crawler model

The current crawler implementation supports these activity types:

- `meetings`
- `gifts`
- `hospitality`
- `travel`
- `outside_employment`

There is no generic `other` activity type in the current code path.
